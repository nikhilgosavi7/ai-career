The website I've created is a AI Career Adviser designed to help students in India discover suitable career paths. It provides a simple, step-by-step process to generate personalized career recommendations based on your academic background and personal interests.

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of its key features:

Guided Career Exploration: The app first asks for your current education level (after the 10th or 12th standard) to tailor the recommendations.

Specialization Selection: You can then choose from popular streams like Engineering, Medical, or Business, and select your preferred specialization within that field.

Personalized Recommendations: Based on your selections, the app generates a list of potential career paths that align with your interests.

Detailed Career Insights: For each recommended career, you'll find comprehensive information including the estimated salary range, a description of what the job entails, and a clear career progression pathway.

Founder Information: The "About" section includes your personal details and those of your team members.

This tool aims to provide a clear roadmap for students as they decide on their future professional journey.
